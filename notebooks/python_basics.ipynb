    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. What does that mean? It means everything is an object. Did that explain nothing? Oops. Let's dive right in and hopefully make sense of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"install\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually before we dive, we should probably make sure that there's a swimming pool, lake, or some other body of water that we can actually jump into, so let's talk python installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's some python installation on the grid, but it is... bleh. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download your own python from <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">the python website itself</a> or any other distribution such as <a href=\"https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/\">Enthought Canopy</a> or <a href=\"https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html\">Conda</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason people may download Canopy or Conda (specifically Anaconda) instead of just plain old python is that they're distributions that come with an additional set of scientific libraries/packages, which you would otherwise have to download yourself one by one. I prefer Conda, so that's what we're going to talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is a repository management system, which means that, in addition to giving us python and a bunch of libraries, it also manages them for us. Libraries tend not to exist as standalones. They have a lot of dependencies, which means that one package may not run if you don't have another. Conda will keep track of that for you, so if it installs a new package for you, it'll check that package's dependencies and download/install whatever you're missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda has a couple of download options: Anaconda and Miniconda. A breakdown of the benefits of each can be found <a href=\"https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html\">here</a>. Anaconda comes pre-packaged with a lot of libraries that are helpful to us, though neuroimaging-specific ones will still need to be installed separately. Anaconda is the recommended installation for people who are new to python, but feel free to pick whichever and then follow the instructions on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to keeping track of dependencies during installation, Conda also allows us to create separate environments in case we want to use different versions of python or any of its packages for different projects. You can find the details <a href=\"https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\">here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Interpreters<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"interpret\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to write your python code in a script, you can do so in any text editor: gedit (if you must), vim (don't be afraid of it), <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\">pycharm</a> (since it's python specific, it has a lot of great features like debugging, tips on more efficient code writing, and keeping track of your variables/imports), etc. Save the text file with the extension \".py\". However, this python code won't do you any good without an interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "<em>python</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this command in the terminal, you will get a self-contained python interpreter. It'll run python code and python code only. You can also use <font color=\"blue\"><em>python &lt;script_name.py&gt;</em></font> to run a python script as a command line in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>ipython</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interpreter that lives in the terminal, ipython is a souped up version of python. It'll allow some shell commands along with a couple of helpful other tricks, e.g., double tabs for path completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>jupyter notebook</em> (formerly <em>ipython notebook</em>)\n",
    "\n",
    "python and ipython are great for running code, but once you exit out of them, whatever you've run and outputted is gone. The notebook is an interpreter that allows us to run code in pieces, save it along with its outputs, and do write ups. <em>jupyter notebook</em> is available through Anaconda by default, but if you have Miniconda installed instead, you may need to install it separately. NB: running this on the grid is less straightforward than running it on your personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"start\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than have everyone install their own python, there's one on the grid that you're free to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">/ifs/loni/faculty/thompson/four_d/igc_basics/anaconda3/bin/ipython</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this please add the following line to your source file (~/.bashrc)\n",
    "\n",
    "    export PATH=/ifs/loni/faculty/thompson/four_d/igc_basics/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "and then in the terminal run\n",
    "\n",
    "    source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "This is python 3.6. There are some differences between python 2 and python 3, but for the most part you won't notice them. (There's also a v2.7 environment that you can use via the command \"source activate py27\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign a variable by using the equal sign (=). The only constraint on variable names is that they can't begin with numbers. Anything else is free game. These variable names are case specific. If you mistype a variable name or try to call one that hasn't been assigned yet, you'll get a <font color=\"red\">NameError</font>. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also comment out text by starting it with a pound sign (#).\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote><p>In ipython and the notebook, adding a question mark immediately after a function will give you the help file. We'll go through some examples below. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You can also use tab/double tab to try to autofill variable or function names.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><font color=\"red\">Please note that these do not work if you just run <em>python</em>.</font></p></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object types <a class=\"anchor\" id='types'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say everything in python is an object, we mean that everything is a type of something with a given blueprint. As part of this blueprint, objects (types) have two things associated with them: attributes and methods. We can think of attributes as nouns and methods as verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically speaking, we can call these attributes and methods by\n",
    "\n",
    "    object.attribute\n",
    "    object.method()\n",
    "\n",
    "I will now borrow an analogy from my friend Anisha to make things clearer. Let's consider a cell phone as our object. A cell phone can have attributes, such as a contacts page, and it can perform functions, such as calling people.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an object, the cell phone is just a concept. Theoretically, we can save phone numbers in one or call people, but the concept of a phone doesn't really do us any good unless we actually have one in hand. In python, these specific objects are known as instances. To stick with the cell phone analogy, an instance would be my android phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now obviously not all objects in the world are cell phones. In fact, none of the objects in python are cell phones, so let's go over some different python objects/types. To start with, the type of a variable or expression can be determined using the <em>type( )</em> function. \n",
    "\n",
    "    type(variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the type of the variable that you've given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the type of your variable is important because functions are generally written to operate on a specific type or subset of types. Giving the wrong type of variable to a function will give us a <font color=\"red\">TypeError</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings <a class=\"anchor\" id='str'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is any number of characters that are grouped together to be one entity. These characters can be any combination of letters, spaces, numbers, punctuation marks, etc. The string can be bookended by either ' or \". The only thing that matters is that you use the same quotation mark at the beginning and the end. This is useful because this gives us the ability to have quotes or apostrophes in a string as long as the character that you use in the string is different than the quote delineating the string (examples: \"Neda's nerds\", '\"Black Panther\" came out earlier this year.'). You can also use ''' or \"\"\", but this is usually used for doc strings or large blocks of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with creating a simple string."
